# epic-react-course

Working through the [epic react course](https://epicreact.dev/) exercises.

Each level is it's own branch. Exercises only here. 


## Instructions to me

Clone the original repo and create a branch for that level. Then add the .gitignore file to it. Then run `git rm -r --cached .` to remove cached git folders and files. Now we can do the set up and exercises.

Once the level is completed try `git mv src [level-name]` to rename the folder and merge to master?
